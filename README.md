# Raspberry-Pi
<h3>The Raspberry Pi has pins called GPIO pins, these 40 pins are located on the left edge of the board and GPIO stand for General-Purpose Input/Output. These pins can be programmed to control electronic items. </h3>

<h3>To begin our project we first had to set up the raspberry pi and divide the work between the four of us. We began by building a simpler version of the vending machine on a breadboard, like the image below. This is because we will be using our code to run the machine rather than all of the extra wires and resistors.</h3>

<h3>Below is what our code looks like in the first stages. We started by making a while loop. We also plugged information into certain words so that we can refer back to it.</h3>
